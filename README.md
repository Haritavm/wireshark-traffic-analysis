# Wireshark Traffic Analysis Lab

## Overview
This lab captures and analyzes live network traffic using Wireshark. It demonstrates protocol identification, packet inspection, and documentation best practices.

## Contents
- `capture.pcap`: Raw packet capture file
- `report.md`: Protocol analysis summary
- `screenshots/`: Visual evidence of packet flow and protocol diversity

## Protocols Identified
- TCP (handshake and data transfer)
- HTTP (GET and response)
- DNS (domain resolution)
- TLSv1.2 (secure handshake)
- QUIC (modern transport over UDP)
- UDP (used by DNS and QUIC)
